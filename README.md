# euler

My solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems.
There are probably going to be subdirectories for different languages,
for now there's only C++ since I'm currently learning that.

The soutions are most likely not perfect, they reflect what I came up with on
my own. Also, since I'm doing this partly to learn a new language, things might
be implemented in a weird or roundabout way so I can try out some new concept.
